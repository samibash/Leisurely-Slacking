# TITLE: 
Leisurely Slacking

# SUMMARY:
We are building a leisure and travel guide full-stack application with create, read, update, and delete functionality. This application's purpose is to suggest the best places to travel to in the world for every month of the calendar year. In addition to suggeting the location, we also suggest the best bars/pubs to visit while you're there as well. Each desired month will feature an image of the destination; description; and hotel information with a link. A list of top-rated bars/pubs will also feature on a map near the selected destination as well.

# CHALLENGES:
Some major challenges for our team includes:

* Getting Mapbox functional and running in time
* Creating/populating user input onto webpage
